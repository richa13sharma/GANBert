In scope predictions:
Data: The data for this experiment can be found under the folder 'data' .  It is the file from the CLINC150 repository found at this link: 
This file has to be copied onto google colab for this set of experiments. 
The folder 'in-scope' contains the notebooks for the different split variations of data. Each notebook is one kind of split variation. The split variation 10-90 essentially serves as the base variation of the data. 

Out of scope (oos) predictions:
No data has to be copied onto colab since we are using hugging face for this experiment.
The experiment for oos prediction can be found under the folder 'out-of-scope'.
